Description: Calculates significant annotations (categories) in each of
        two (or more) feature (i.e. gene) lists, determines the overlap
        between the annotations, and returns graphical and tabular data
        about the significant annotations and which combinations of
        feature lists the annotations were found to be significant.
        Interactive exploration is facilitated through the use of
        RCytoscape (heavily suggested).
SystemRequirements: Cytoscape (>= 3.6.1) (if used for visualization of
        results, heavily suggested)
TODO: Text and HTML output without graphs.
